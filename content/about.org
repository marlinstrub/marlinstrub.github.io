* About

I'm a Robotics Technologist at [[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/][NASA/JPL]], where I currently lead the path-planning efforts for a snake-like robot called [[https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/][Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS)]] and  for the [[https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/spacecraft/sample-recovery-helicopters/][Sample Recovery Helicopters (SRH)]] ground mobility control.

I hold a PhD in Engineering Science from the [[https://www.ox.ac.uk/][University of Oxford]], where I was a member of the [[https://robotic-esp.com/][Estimation, Search, and Planning (ESP) Group]] led by [[https://robotic-esp.com/people/gammell/][Dr. Jonathan D. Gammell]]. My research at Oxford focused on designing and implementing path-planning algorithms that leverage different sources of information to improve planning performance for complex systems in robotics and beyond. I also hold an MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from [[https://ethz.ch/en.html][ETH ZÃ¼rich]]. If you're interested in my work, please take a look at my [[./publications.org][publications]]. All of the algorithms I designed at ESP are publicly available in the [[https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/][Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)]] under a [[https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/license.html#bsdlicense][BSD license]].
