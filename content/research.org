* Research interests

My primary research interests are path planning and control algorithms. I enjoy and have experience in designing algorithms, analyzing them analytically, implementing them in C++, evaluating them empirically, and deploying them on real-world systems. I'm proud that my work was useful to other researchers, some of my favorite examples are when:

  - CMU and Mistral AI used AIT* with LLMs for robotic tasks ([[https://openreview.net/pdf?id=2q14O7h8Zm][paper]])
  - The University of Oxford used AIT* on their drone ([[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03484.pdf][paper]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVIXu2qUQJ8][video]])
  - MIT used AIT* to create training data for ML-based planning ([[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11414.pdf][paper]])
  - JPL used ABIT* on the wheel-on-limb robot /RoboSimian/ ([[http://ras.papercept.net/images/temp/IROS/files/2141.pdf][paper]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1NHKBZE_g][video]])
  - Nagoya University used AIT* for minimally invasive surgery ([[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230219][paper]])
  
* Real-world deployments

I have deployed my research on two of NASA/JPL's +coolest+ subjectively most interesting rover prototypes: [[*Axel][Axel]] and [[*EELS][EELS]]. Here are short introductions and links to further information.

** Axel

Some of the most interesting science targets of planetary exploration are located on steep slopes beyond the reach of the currently-deployed rovers. Examples of such targets include lava-tubes on the Moon, meteor-craters on Mars, and ice-crevasses on En­ce­la­dus. Axel is a rappelling rover-prototype that is designed to navigate such terrains and carry scientific payloads to study them.

While Axel presented the team with various challenges, my work was focused on its autonomy stack. My primary contribution was formulating the path-planning problem in a way that can be solved by ABIT*, a sampling-based planning algorithm I had previously developed.

The main challenge in doing so was due to Axel's tether. When planning paths for Axel, we made ABIT* analyze the static stability of each state using gravity-, tether- and ground-reaction-forces. The tether-force at any given state depends on where the tether most recently anchored to the ground, which in turn depends on the path Axel took to that state. These types of non-Markovian problems must be handled with care in any sampling-based planning algorithm. Our [[https://robotic-esp.com/papers/paton_iros20.pdf][IROS 2020 paper]] presents an approach that includes the relevant state history in the state space. This idea is not limited to ABIT*, but can be applied to any sampling-based algorithm.


** EELS

Enceladus, a small moon of Saturn, has large water plumes at its south pole. They are thought to be connected to a global ocean underneath Enceladus' icy surface and make Enceladus a prime target for the search of extraterrestrial life. Unfortunately, Enceladus is far away and a lot about its surface is still unknown. To deal with this uncertainty, I helped JPL develop EELS, a snake-like robot with /active skin/ (i.e., screws along its body). [[https://youtu.be/e0D9IVo-E9M?si=LdHYoO4WN43e7DCN][Here's a video]] that describes the system and concept of operations, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifCIDT4X9AM][here's another video]] that showcases some early results.
