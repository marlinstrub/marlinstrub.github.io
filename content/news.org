#+html: <details><summary><b>Jul 2023</b> Our EELS paper was accepted at IROS.</summary>
The [[https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/][Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS)]] team wrote a paper that presents control and planning algorithms for EELS. One of the core ideas of the paper is to decouple shape control from motion control for screw-based gaits. This lets us tackle the control and planning problems with relatively simple algorithms despite the many (>30) degrees of freedom EELS has.

A reference implementation of the final algorithm of my PhD thesis is now also publicly available in the [[https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/][Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)]]. Implementing this has been more of a challenge than anticipated, both technically and in terms of making time for it.

I was promoted to Robotics Technologist at JPL. Fortunately my responsibilities stay the same, so I still get to do hands-on robotics work on the [[https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/][Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS)]] and the [[https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/spacecraft/sample-recovery-helicopters/][Sample Recovery Helicopters (SRH)]] ground mobility effort.

#+html: <details><summary><b>Aug 2022</b> Wil's TMIT* paper was published in RA-L.</summary>
I coauthored a paper with [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qsIX7joAAAAJ&hl=en][Wil]] and [[https://robotic-esp.com/gammell/][Jon]] that presents Task and Motion Informed Trees (TMIT*), an integrated task and motion planning algorithm. TMIT* combines AIT* with [[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~wil/papers/isrr2019_unifiedtamp.pdf][PLANET]] to improve performance when high-level tasks, such as sorting potentially stacked objects, require reasoning about the order in which path-planning problems are to be executed.

#+html: <details><summary><b>Jan 2022</b> I started as a postdoc at NASA/JPL.</summary>
I accepted a position as a postdoctoral researcher at NASA/JPL. I'm part of the autonomy team for a snake-like robot called [[https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/][EELS]] that is being built to explore alien worlds. My work focuses on coming up with path planning and control approaches for EELS and includes contributing to the corresponding modules in its C++ autonomy stack.

#+html: <details><summary><b>Jan 2022</b> I passed my viva at the University of Oxford!</summary>
I passed my viva (Ph.D. defense) at the University of Oxford. There are umpteen people to thank. Here I just want to thank Jon for letting me stand on his shoulders these past three years and Nick and Wheeler for their time and constructive criticism. It is sincerely appreciated!

#+html: <details><summary><b>Nov 2021</b> The journal paper on AIT* & EIT* was accepted at IJRR.</summary>
My first journal paper got accepted at IJRR. AIT* and EIT* improve planning performance by leveraging multiple sources of information with an asymmetric bidirectional search. The paper will be published in 2022 but you can already find a preprint [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01877][on arxiv]] and a high-level presentation of it [[https://youtu.be/aC2xBwOcDoo][on youtube]].

#+html: <details><summary><b>Apr 2021</b> I wrote about heuristics for obstacle clearance.</summary>
Obstacle clearance in search space is an important optimization objective in path planning because it can result in safe paths. This technical report presents admissible heuristics that can improve planning performance when optimizing this objective. You can find the report [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02298][on arxiv]].

#+html: <details><summary><b>Mar 2021</b> I became a co-maintainer of OMPL.</summary>
The [[https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/][Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)]] has been immensely useful in my own research and I'm stoked to join its impressive team of maintainers. Very much looking forward to contributing more to OMPL.

#+html: <details><summary><b>Sep 2020</b> I made my first (tiny) contribution to Emacs.</summary>
I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] for many things (too many, perhaps). Emacs has [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], which is, among other things, an excellent tool for note-taking and journaling. I fixed [[https://github.com/TonCherAmi/org-starless/issues/1][this tiny bug]] in org-mode that was exposed by a package that (subjectively) improves the appearance of org-mode by hiding some markdown.

#+html: <details><summary><b>Sep 2020</b> Jon's survey was accepted at ARCRAS.</summary>
I assisted Jon in surveying the field of asymptotically optimal sampling-based path planning algorithms for an invited paper in the /Annual Review of Controls, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems/. The paper will be published in 2021, but you can find a preprint of it [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06599][on arxiv]].

#+html: <details><summary><b>Aug 2020</b> Mike's paper was accepted at IROS.</summary>
I coauthored a paper that presents the autonomy system used on Axel during the field trial last summer. The autonomy system includes a stability analysis that predicts the interaction of Axel's tether with the terrain. My main contribution was to describe how we adapted ABIT* to work with Axel's tether-induced non-Markovian states. You can find an open-access version of it [[https://robotic-esp.com/papers/paton_iros20.html][on the ESP website]].

#+html: <details><summary><b>May 2020</b> ABIT* and AIT* were merged into OMPL.</summary>
ABIT* and AIT* were merged into the [[https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/][Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)]]. This constitutes my first major contribution to an open-source library and I'm hoping ABIT* and AIT* will be useful for someone.

#+html: <details><summary><b>Feb 2020</b> I made my first contribution to OpenRAVE.</summary>
I implemented a feature that allows using the [[https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl][Flexible Collision Library (FCL)]] for distance queries in [[https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave][OpenRAVE]]. This constitutes my first minor contribution to an open-source library and I'm very happy to finally being able to contribute back to the community.

#+html: <details><summary><b>Feb 2020</b> Adaptively Informed Trees (AIT*) was accepted at ICRA.</summary>
My second paper got accepted at ICRA. AIT* improves planning performance with an asymmetric bidirectional search in which both searches continuously inform each other with complementary information. You can find the AIT* paper [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06599][on arxiv]] and a high-level presentation of it [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h7ugF9F6VM][on youtube]].

#+html: <details><summary><b>Jan 2018</b> We rowed across the Atlantic!</summary>
[[https://www.swissmocean.ch/][Swiss Mocean]] took third place in the 2017 [[https://www.taliskerwhiskyatlanticchallenge.com/][Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge]] and became the first Swiss fours to row any ocean.
