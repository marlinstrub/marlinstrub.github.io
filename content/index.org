* Hi, I'm Marlin

I enjoy designing, implementing, and deploying planning and control algorithms that are both theoretically sound and perform well in practice. I'm currently a Robotics Engineer at [[https://www.gravisrobotics.com][Gravis Robotics]], where we automate heavy machinery to facilitate autonomous construction. Before joining Gravis, I was a Robotics Technologist at [[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/][NASA/JPL]], where I led the path-planning efforts for a snake-like robot called [[https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/][EELS]] and the [[https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/spacecraft/sample-recovery-helicopters/][new Mars helicopters]].

When I'm not working with robots, I like sharing delicious food, engaging in deep conversation, and spending time in the remote outdoors.

* Education

I hold a PhD in Engineering Science from the [[https://www.ox.ac.uk/][University of Oxford]], where I was a member of the [[https://robotic-esp.com/][Estimation, Search, and Planning (ESP) Group]] led by [[https://robotic-esp.com/people/gammell/][Dr. Jonathan D. Gammell]]. My research at Oxford focused on designing and implementing path-planning algorithms that can leverage different sources of information to improve planning performance for complex systems in robotics and beyond. I also hold an MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from [[https://ethz.ch/en.html][ETH Zürich]]. If you're interested in my work, please take a look at my [[./research.org][research]] and [[./publications.org][publications]] pages.

* Open-source contributions

I'm passionate about open-source software. Reference implementations of all algorithms I designed at ESP are publicly available in the [[https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/][Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)]], which I'm currently a co-maintainer of. [[https://robotic-esp.com/gammell/][Jon]] and I also open-sourced our [[https://github.com/robotic-esp/pdt][planner benchmark and development framework]], which automatically generates publication-ready performance plots in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ][PGF/TikZ]] whenever a benchmark is run (here's our [[https://robotic-esp.com/papers/gammell_empp22.pdf][workshop paper]] about it). I additionally contributed features and bug-fixes to various other projects, including [[https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave][OpenRAVE]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].
