<details><summary><b>Jul 2023</b> <span class="icon-publication"></span> Our EELS paper was accepted at IROS.</summary>
<p>
The <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/">Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS)</a> team wrote a paper that presents control and planning algorithms for EELS. One of the core ideas of the paper is to decouple shape control from motion control for screw-based gaits. This lets us tackle the control and planning problems with relatively simple algorithms despite the many (&gt;30) degrees of freedom EELS has. The paper was nominated for a best-paper award.

<details><summary><b>Feb 2023</b> <span class="icon-code"></span> Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) was merged into OMPL.</summary>
<p>
A reference implementation of EIT* (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01877">arxiv</a>, <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1177/02783649211069572">doi</a>), the final algorithm of my PhD thesis, is now also publicly available in the <a href="https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/">Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)</a>. Implementing this has been more of a challenge than anticipated, both technically and in terms of making time for it.
</p>

EIT* is not included in the official OMPL documentation yet, but you can find its header file <a  href="https://github.com/ompl/ompl/blob/19e007c97e7d500270798b53f243592c4428cb10/src/ompl/geometric/planners/informedtrees/EITstar.h#L57">here</a>.

I was promoted to Robotics Technologist at JPL. Fortunately my responsibilities stay the same, so I still get to do hands-on robotics work on the <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/">Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS)</a> and the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/spacecraft/sample-recovery-helicopters/">Sample Recovery Helicopters (SRH)</a> ground mobility effort.

<details><summary><b>Sep 2022</b> <span class="icon-field-test"></span> We went on a 2nd NASA/JPL field trial in Alberta, CA.</summary>
<p>
I conducted another field trial with the <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/">Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS)</a> team, again on the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Atk21sDF6aaw97J9">Athabasca Glacier</a>. This time we stayed on the ice for three weeks and tested two robots and multiple science instruments. It was even better than last time, as we were able to move more independently on the glacier having had more rope-training in advance.

<details><summary><b>Aug 2022</b> <span class="icon-publication"></span> Wil's TMIT* paper was published in RA-L.</summary>
<p>
I coauthored a paper with <a href="https://wbthomason.com/">Wil</a> and <a href="https://robotic-esp.com/gammell/">Jon</a> that presents Task and Motion Informed Trees (TMIT*; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09367">arxiv</a>, <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3199676">doi</a>), an integrated task and motion planning algorithm. TMIT* combines AIT* with <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~wil/papers/isrr2019_unifiedtamp.pdf">PLANET</a> to improve performance when high-level tasks, such as sorting potentially stacked objects, require reasoning about the order in which path-planning problems are to be executed.

<p>
I coauthored a paper with <a href="https://vhartmann.com/">Valentin</a> and <a href="https://robotic-esp.com/gammell/">Jon</a> that presents Effort Informed Roadmaps (<a href="./publications.html#hartmann_isrr2022">EIRM*</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08480">arxiv</a>), an multi-query extension to EIT*. EIRM* deliberatively reuses search-effort when solving path-planning problems that are similar to problems it has solved before. This improves performance on successive problems compared to popular single-query and multi-query planners, including EIT*, RRT-Connect, and PRM*.

I accepted a position as a postdoctoral researcher at NASA/JPL. I'm part of the autonomy team for a snake-like robot called <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/exobiology-extant-life-surveyor-eels/">EELS</a> that is being built to explore alien worlds. My work focuses on coming up with path planning and control approaches for EELS and includes contributing to the corresponding modules in its C++ autonomy stack.

<details><summary><b>Apr 2021</b> <span class="icon-publication"></span> My report on obstacle-clearance heuristics is on arXiv.</summary>
<p>
Obstacle clearance in search space is an important optimization objective in path planning because it can result in safe paths. This technical report presents admissible heuristics that can improve planning performance when optimizing this objective (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02298">arxiv</a>).

<p>
I helped <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/michael_paton/">Mike</a> with a paper that presents the autonomy system used on <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/systems/the-axel-rover/">Axel</a> during the field trial last summer. The autonomy system includes a stability analysis that predicts the interaction of Axel's tether with the terrain. My main contribution was to describe how we adapted ABIT* to work with Axel's tether-induced non-Markovian states. You can find an open-access version of it on the <a href="https://robotic-esp.com/papers/paton_iros20.html">ESP website</a>.
